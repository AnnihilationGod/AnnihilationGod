### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m currently working on GME ETF Data.
New to Github, so if I got anything wrong, just tell me.
Regarding the files I uploaded on 18. July 2021:
The presented data sets contain the extracted GME ETF data for all ETFs that contain GME.

If you compare my shared data set with the original files from


Finra http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html

NYSE https://ftp.nyse.com/ShortData/

CBOE https://www.cboe.com/us/equities/market_statistics/short_sale/?mkt=byx

NASDAQ ftp://ftp.nasdaqtrader.com/files/shortsaledata/daily/ (just accessible via IE)



you will see a difference in who data is structured.

Reason for this: 

Some exchanges, like f.e. AMEX (https://ftp.nyse.com/ShortData/Amexshvol/) had a change in data structure over time.


2009 - 2017 

Date|Symbol|Short Volume|Total Volume|Market


2017 - today 

Date|Symbol|Short Exempt Volume|Short Volume|Total Volume|Market


This lead to issues while working on the data - and made it more complicated to work with the data.

For this reason I decided to put ALL data into the exact same formation with the following structure:

Date|Symbol|Short Volume|Short Exempt Volume|Total Volume|Market



What does this mean regarding the data? 

I added a Short Exempt Volume to the whole CBOE(BATS, BYXX. EDGA, EDGA)- and NASDAQ (NQBX, NPSX)-Data  even they are NOT reporting a Short Exempt Volume!

I added a Short Exempt Volume to NYSE (AMEX, ARCA, Chicago, Nationals, NYSE)  for the periode of >2017 and changed data structure <2017 from:


Date|Symbol|Short Exempt Volume|Short Volume|Total Volume|Market

to

Date|Symbol|Short Volume|Short Exempt Volume|Total Volume|Market


I addad a Short Exempt Volume to reported FINRA data >2012 even if there is not reported SEV for this periode - while data <2012 was already in the correct structure. 


Okay, more information about the data provided:


The Files are seperated by exchange and oragnised in alphabetic and ascending order. 

All data now has the same structure. 

The FTD is organised in alphabetic and ascending order.
